# nosql-challenge

In this challenge, I  play a data analyist contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate food hygiene ratings data from the UK Food Standards Agency in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.  

Relevant code can be found in the files NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb.
